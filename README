TLDR

This is a proof of concept assembly of the following parts: 

  * a parser written in parslet[1] for HTTP headers
  * some glue code from net-http-server[2]
  * a tcp server written using cod[3]
  * rack
  
The example simple.{rb,ru} proves that these form a minimal rack webserver
just like net-http-server or webrick. 

WHY

This is an experiment to try and see what the minimal amount of code for such
a server is today. My plan is to develop this further into something almost
unicorn-like, without inflating code size.
